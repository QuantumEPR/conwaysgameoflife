## Introduction
(你从维基百科上写一段然后放一个维基百科的链接，这样正式一点)

## Game Rules
### For a space is "populated"
    Each cell with one or no neighbours dies, as if by solitude
    Each cell with four or more neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation
    Each cell with two or three neighbours survives
### For a space is "empty or unpopulated"
    Each cell with three neighbours becomes populated
